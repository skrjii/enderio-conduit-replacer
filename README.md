# Conduit Replacer

## Description
Adds a tool for quickly replacing conduits of a given type across an Ender IO conduit network.

Current features:
* Conduit Replacer tool for mass-replacing conduits. Middle-click conduits to set the source and replacement types, then left-click conduit bundles to perform replacements. Replacement conduits are consumed from inventory (except in creative mode).

* GUI for configuring source and replacement conduit types. Supports dragging items from JEI into ghost slots for easy configuration.

* Category compatibility checking to ensure source and replacement conduits are compatible (e.g., both energy conduits, both item conduits, etc.).

* Preserves conduit connections and settings where possible. Warns when upgrades or filters cannot be transferred.
